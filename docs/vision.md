# Product Vision

## Product Name (Working)
Jinshu

## Mission
Help creators turn written content into Xiaohongshu-style, full-screen image posts in minutes.

## Problem
Creators often publish long-form ideas as picture-based posts. Existing workflows are fragmented:
- Write in one tool.
- Manually design slides in another tool.
- Export repeatedly to fit platform style.

This is slow, inconsistent, and difficult for non-designers.

## Target Users
- Primary: Individual creators posting educational/opinion content on Xiaohongshu.
- Secondary: Small content teams, personal brands, and indie marketers.

## Value Proposition
From text to polished social image posts with live preview and one-click export.

## Product Promise
"Write once, publish visual posts fast."

## Success Metrics (MVP)
- Time-to-first-export: under 5 minutes for new users.
- Activation: at least 40% of signups export at least 1 image set in first session.
- Retention signal: at least 20% of activated users return within 7 days.

## MVP Scope (v1)
- Markdown editor.
- Live preview (page-by-page, mobile/full-screen style).
- 5-10 built-in high-quality templates.
- Export image set (PNG) for multi-page posts.
- Basic project save/load.

## Out of Scope (v1)
- Full rich-text collaborative editor.
- Full LaTeX support.
- Template marketplace.
- Team workspaces and permissions.

## Monetization Direction
Freemium:
- Free: limited exports/templates.
- Pro subscription: premium templates, higher export quota, advanced formatting (later Markdown+LaTeX enhancements).

## Risks
- Rendering quality gap vs native design tools.
- Template quality must be strong enough to justify adoption.
- Copyright/IP risk in user-generated assets (need policy + terms).

## Strategic Principle
Optimize for speed and quality of output, not editor feature breadth.
